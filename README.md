Introduction
============

ezgdi aims to provide [gdi++](http://drwatson.nobody.jp/gdi++/index-en.html)-like font rendering for 64-bit applications on Windows.

This project originated from gdi++, which depends on [Microsoft Detours](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/detours/). Detours is a great library, but it is not freely available for 64-bit applications, which is the reason why gdi++ doesn't work with 64-bit applications.

[EasyHook](https://easyhook.codeplex.com) is an open-source alternative to Detours that supports 64-bit applications.

The ezgdi project is still in alpha testing. It may cause applications crash; it may also cause other (possibly irreversible) damage, so **use at your own risk**.
